     "evalue": "could not convert string to float: 'A decent salad at a non-chain restaurant. No dessert, though. three horse head emojis in a row. I had a friend [41F] who went through a bad breakup. After two years, she was still *very* upset about it. Since we both went through bad breakups at the same time (mine from a physically, verbally, and emotionally abusive man who I lived with for three years), we were very supportive of one another initially, and even moved in together as roommates - but I got over my breakup and she did not. She would want to talk about her ex and what had happened with them for hours and hours at a time, whenever she wanted to do it, and since we lived together I had little escape from listening to her re-hash the situation and talk about how painful it was - years later. She even compared her relationship to mine, which was exceedingly abusive, and said I was \"lucky\" because my ex had moved out of town and hers, who was not abusive, had not. Her breakup was confusing - her ex just basically dropped her out of the blue and never spoke to her again - so I can understand why it was a difficult thing for her, but still... needing to talk for hours after years? With someone who isn\\'t your therapist?\\n\\nAt a certain point (after about eight months of being regaled with tales of her ex on a very regular - biweekly to monthly - basis), I told her I wasn\\'t helping her anymore and that I didn\\'t want to talk about it. In truth, I was very upset that she felt like she could interrupt me any time, often when I was working (I work a lot from home because I have a demanding job), and frankly? Her issues were not getting better. I\\'m not a therapist and I could not help her anymore. She claimed I was wrong, that she wasn\\'t talking about her ex at all, and then curbed her behavior a bit. In response, I started keeping a private log of times she did talk about her ex with me, and how long it went on for, because I felt like maybe I was going crazy. \\n\\nUnfortunately, there were still many situations where she would corner me and \"need\" to talk for hours at a time. This happened on a monthly basis instead of bi-weekly. She would apologize for \"wasting my time\" but she didn\\'t seem to understand that she was breaking a boundary by doing this. It came to a head when she called me while I was at work one day because she saw a person that looked like her ex. Just someone who looked like her ex - not her ex. That made me very angry, because it derailed my work for several hours - mostly because I was fuming that she had called for what, frankly, was to me a very ridiculous thing.  \\n\\nI told her that I no longer wanted a friendship with her because she had violated my boundaries too many times (actually, I used \"I\" language, and said \"I have trouble maintaining firm boundaries with you\"). She responded by saying that actually *I* violated *her* boundaries because I had a perception that she was breaking my boundaries when she really wasn\\'t, and that she couldn\\'t handle me telling her to stop stepping on my personal boundaries when she wasn\\'t doing it and hadn\\'t ever talked about her ex to me *at all*. Do I not understand boundaries? Or am I OK? Is it possible to break someone\\'s boundaries by telling them that they are stepping on your own? You shouldn\\'t need to convince. I think you can say exactly what you said here: \"I\\'m uncomfortable spending so much on going out to eat together. I\\'d love to take you out sometimes, my treat, but not as often as we\\'ve been going out.\"\\n\\nYou also might consider seeing if she wants to learn how to cook a new cuisine together. My boyfriend and I used to eat all our meals out, and now we make most of them together at home. Get a bottle of wine, some crushed tomatoes, an onion, and spaghetti, and make a romantic dinner. Make meatballs, too, if you\\'re feeling like you\\'re up for more of a challenge. Drink the wine while you\\'re cooking, but save some for dinner. It\\'s a blast, it\\'s less expensive, and you\\'re learning something new and fun together, which can definitely strengthen the relationship. My advice for you is to take care of yourself. That is the best thing you can do right now, both for yourself and for her.\\n\\nYou don\\'t need to make any decisions right now. Just keep asking yourself how you feel about your relationship with her. This is the relationship that you have right now, unfortunately - one that is just texting. She sounds like she is not ready to be in a relationship. She can\\'t be a partner and she isn\\'t able to do it right now.\\n\\nSee how you feel in two weeks, in a month, in two months. Take care of yourself. Is there a hobby that you\\'ve always been interested in starting? Now would be a great time to pick that hobby up. \\n\\nTake care. She told me that my \"misperception\" of her talking about her ex to me - saying she was doing it when she claims she wasn\\'t - was what violated her boundaries. \\n\\nI do think that in her mind she never talks about her ex, because she wants to talk about her ex *all the time*. I think she\\'s thinking of her ex constantly. Every object and every thing she did had some kind of connection to her ex, however tenuous. So every day that goes by where she doesn\\'t verbally mention the ex probably stands out to her in her mind much more saliently than the moments where she does talk of them.\\n\\nAnyhow, thanks to everyone for the comments. I feel a bit better knowing that the only \"boundary\" I\\'ve stepped on here is the one where she wants her friends to be her therapist. Thankfully, we were never married. I was in an abusive relationship for three years. My ex checked all those boxes as well when we first started dating. It did eventually escalate and get physical. But that doesn\\'t even matter. One thing I learned from my abusive relationship is that a person doesn\\'t have to be abusive to make it OK to not want to be with them. \\n\\nI\\'ll say that again: A person does not have to be abusive to make it OK to not want to be with them.\\n\\nYou say \"I don\\'t know how to feel\" here but I think you know how you feel - you just don\\'t know what to *do* with those feelings. Here are some of the things you\\'re feeling, based on the words you used in your post:\\n\\n* You\\'re going to college and don\\'t want to have an LDR\\n* You feel pressured to do things physically that you\\'re not comfortable with\\n* You feel tired of enforcing your boundaries\\n* You feel confused that you have to keep reinforcing your boundaries with him\\n* You feel compromised and violated\\n* You don\\'t feel like you want to marry this guy\\n* You feel like he\\'s blaming you when he crosses your clear boundaries\\n\\nMy advice? Stop seeing this guy. You say he is your best friend, but friends don\\'t treat one another this way.\\n\\nTake care. The first thing you should do is call the domestic violence hotline at 1-800-799-7233. They can do a number of things, including: listen to you vent, help you come up with a safety plan, and connect you with a shelter in your area.\\n\\nI know that the words \"domestic violence\" and \"abuse\" are not pleasant to even consider. I have been in a similar situation and it was very difficult for me to come to terms with the word \"abuse.\" The first time I called the DV hotline, I felt ridiculous. Like I wasn\\'t worthy of using up their time with my silly difficult relationship, which surely wasn\\'t abusive because he hadn\\'t hit me. Yet.\\n\\nBut I\\'m so glad I called. I left that man two years ago and my life is so much better. It was hard to get to this point, but the support that I got from my local women\\'s shelter was vital to me and helped me escape a very bad situation with a bad guy.\\n\\nWhile you think about calling them, try to do things to take care of yourself. Go on a walk. Take a hot bath. Paint your fingernails. Make a nice dinner. But it will be very hard to feel complete and whole and genuinely *good* - it will be very difficult to perform routine self-care - if your \"partner\" (I put this in quotes because this doesn\\'t sound like a partnership to me) is someone who treats you like garbage. I know this from personal experience.\\n\\nEven though he is controlling and difficult and makes your life very, very hard, you still probably love him and care for him. It might be hard to even think of him as abusive. And that\\'s OK. The DV hotline can help you identify whether or not it is abusive (I certainly think it is from where I\\'m standing, but that doesn\\'t matter much) and how to get out if it is. One thing that helped me as I made my way towards leaving my abuser was coming to terms with this truth: The only way to help someone like this is to leave them. Furthermore, you aren\\'t breaking a vow or a pact if you do leave. Divorce is serious, but marriage means that you *both* take care of one another and support one another. He\\'s not holding up his end of the deal by behaving this way.\\n\\nTake care, and good luck. It sounds to me like it might be helpful for you to work on slowing down in the future. This type of thing is very common if you become infatuated at first sight, like you did here. Infatuation, or [limerance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerence), can blind us.\\n\\nOne thing I like to do when I am seeing someone new is I take up a new hobby at the same time. This helps me focus on myself and on things I enjoy at the same time that I\\'m meeting someone new. It keeps me from getting infatuated.\\n\\nNo one is perfect, and love takes a long time to develop. I think that there are some situations where \"love at first sight\" happens, sure, but I think that there\\'s never anything wrong with going slowly. If it\\'s real love, it will work - if it\\'s not, protecting yourself and not getting too invested too soon can help you from feeling devastated when it doesn\\'t work out.\\n\\nTake care. It\\'s always hard when someone we thought we really liked turns out to be a different person than we imagined.  This is a scary conversation to have with your partner, because it\\'s kind or make-or-break. I understand. Still, you have laid it out very well here in a clear fashion. You can tell him essentially what you told us:\\n\\n&gt;I feel very serious about you. We share a similar sense of humor, we have similar intellect, and we get along very well in general, aside from having a romantic feelings as well. I\\'ve never had feelings for someone like this before and I feel incredibly vulnerable. I want to talk about making a step forward in our relationship. What do you think about making a more formal committment to one another? If you want some time to think about this before we talk about it, that\\'s totally fine.\\n\\nIt\\'s scary but it is honest and opens the lines of communication. \\n\\nGood luck. You\\'re strong and you can initiate this conversation with him.  I had a boyfriend like your wife. I spent so much time asking this question. \\n\\nThe only answer was not one I wanted to face: you can\\'t change other people, even if it is for the better. It was not within my power as a human to change him into a non-abusive man. This is a cold, hard reality: people cannot be changed unless they change themselves. \\n\\nA lot of the things you say are textbook examples of domestic violence, I am sorry to say, including:\\n\\n* Controlling your personal relationships\\n* Micromanaging your time\\n* Outbursts of anger over slight infarctions related to her preferences (e.g. having her dinner ready on time)\\n* Not allowing you to initiate sex\\n* Blaming you for the problems and taking zero ownership for any issues\\n* Hitting you\\n* Refusing to get help because she refuses to admit she has any problems\\n\\nIt took me years to come to terms with the fact that this was domestic violence, and my boyfriend was an abusive person. And that I couldn\\'t make it stop while also staying with him. \\n\\nThe only way to make it stop is to leave. I know you have a child and that makes things much much harder. Please consider calling the domestic violence hotline, or contacting a local domestic violence center to talk about a safety plan for you and your child. \"Women\\'s\" shelters will also help you. DV does not just happen to women. \\n\\nI\\'m sorry you\\'re going through this. Take care of yourself.  If you have to ask a question that has this much text about another human?\\n\\nYour relationship with said other human is over. \\n\\nI know that might sound a bit hyperbolic, but no one - no one - is worth this much angst and storm and stress. \\n\\nExtricate yourself from this \"friendship\" and go have a drink or a hot bath. You deserve it.  This question is too vague to answer. \\n\\nThat said, the book:\\n\\n[How to be an Adult in Relationships: The Five Keys to Mindful Loving](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1570628122)\\n\\nhas been a very helpful text for me. It has a snarky title, but it\\'s a very useful book.  You need to address the real issue with her. Why were you on OKC? You might have to sit down and really think about the answer to that question.\\n\\nYou have both broken trust here: you for keeping an OKC account open, and her for reading your phone. What kept you from trusting her enough to enough to either delete your OKC account, or to tell her you were keeping it open? And what made her distrust you enough to look at your phone?\\n\\nTrust is earned. You can both start rebuilding it by talking about this stuff. \\n\\n I\\'m 4\\'11\" and I lost 30 pounds 4 years ago, got from 127 to 97 - I know you feel fabulous. Nice work!!! It\\'s so much harder when you\\'re a shortie like we are. :) You should never be in a relationship where someone keeps you a secret. You deserve better than that. Everyone does.\\n\\nI am an insecure person as well, just generally and in romantic relationships. Dating someone who highlighted my insecurities and made me feel crazy only made me more insecure. It was a feedback loop of sorts and fed on itself. I don\\'t recommend it.\\n\\nTake care of yourself. It is OK to feel the way that you feel. Take care of your feelings and give them a voice here. You are not wrong to feel insecure in a relationship that is being kept a secret.  Being in a secret relationship was very isolating for me. I had no one I could share my relationship joys or troubles with except for him. These conditions made it very easy for him to abuse and control me - secretiveness about our relationship was the first red flag.\\n\\nWhat made me leave him was him starting to bring physical violence in to the emotionally and verbally abusive relationship he had created. \\n\\nBut even aside from the abuse, being kept secret made me insecure for many reasons. It made me question why he was hiding me - was there something about me he was ashamed of? Was I not pretty enough or cool enough for him? It made me feel small. It made me feel insignificant: he was a big part of my life, but I was only a minor character in his. It made me feel left out and ignored. \\n\\nBut mostly, for me, it created conditions that were ripe for abuse and control. I worked so hard to be good enough for him to want to shout his love for me from the rooftops. Instead of asking myself: \"Is this man good enough for me?\" I was merely asking \"Am I good enough for him?\" - which is the wrong question to ask in a relationship. \\n\\nRelationships should not make you question yourself at that level for that long. They should prop you up, not pull you down.  She\\'s being very controlling. No one should *unlock the bathroom door* to see what their partner is doing in there. That\\'s very controlling behavior, and you\\'ll be better off with someone who doesn\\'t try to police your sexuality like that. \\n\\nSometimes you just want to masturbate and not have sex, and that\\'s totally fine. People masturbate. If she wants to date someone who doesn\\'t, she\\'ll need to find someone else with a low sex drive or someone who likes being sexually controlled. Not you. You two just have fundamentally mismatched ways of being in the world.\\n\\nPersonally, I\\'d never date someone who wouldn\\'t \"let\" me masturbate (it\\'s my body!) so I\\'m biased. You should date someone who also doesn\\'t care about this.  Yes also: make sure it\\'s not the placebo pills she is skipping. Those are usually a different color and are in the last row of the package. Skipping a placebo is fine - they\\'re just there so that you don\\'t forget to stay on schedule when the pack runs out.  So, the last four pills in the package in the medicine cabinet - that\\'s OK. You don\\'t yet have evidence that she has actually skipped her birth control.\\n\\nI\\'d just ask her: Hey, I saw this in the medicine cabinet. Are you still taking your birth control, or is there something you need to talk with me about? Here\\'s the thing: relationships rely on communication. Y\\'all have to be able to communicate.\\n\\nYou can\\'t seem to communicate with one another. She\\'s talking to him, and you\\'re talking to us. You need to talk to each other.\\n\\nIt sounds like you have tried to talk with her and she\\'s not communicating back. That\\'s a dealbreaker. I am so sorry. You might try talking with her again. Perhaps suggest couples counseling so that you can work together on your communicating. Tell her what you told us. You don\\'t sound jealous or rude or controlling - you sound like someone who has some legitimate fears and concerns about a relationship that is very important to them. Concerned enough that you\\'ve snooped on your girlfriend\\'s phone.\\n\\nIf y\\'all can\\'t talk, this won\\'t work. Best of luck to you. &gt; I know that abuse is defined by whether or not someone feels abused\\n\\nNo, that\\'s not right. Abuse is a systematic and sustained effort to control another person. It\\'s a repeated pattern of events where the victim feels unsafe (\"walking on eggshells\") and unable to set boundaries or engage in other normal human behaviors for fear of being abused verbally, emotionally, sexually, and/or physically. \\n\\nIf you are concerned you are abusive, the best thing you can do for yourself is to get a therapist. That might be helpful either way, because you sound quite gummed up about this whole thing. Having an objective third party to talk with I think will prove very useful for you. \\n\\nBest of luck to you. Take care.  The best relationship advice I have is this: be accepting of your partner. Appreciate them for being themselves. Allow them to be themselves, and give them space to flourish and to be their best self. Pay attention to your partner, and show them affection in a way they can understand. If these things are difficult, communicate about those difficulties. \\n\\nDo the same things for yourself: accept yourself for who you are, allow yourself the space to be yourself, pay attention to how you feel and what you\\'re doing, appreciate yourself and the gifts you bring to the world, and show yourself affection by being kind to yourself and taking care of yourself. \\n\\nEasier said than done, of course, but these five words will unlock human relationships for you: accepting, appreciating, affection, allowing, and acceptance.  This person is referring to a twitter hashtag used by survivors of domestic violence to talk about why they stayed in abusive relationships. \\n\\nI don\\'t think we have enough information to say anything about whether or not this situation is abusive, though. The OP certainly doesn\\'t think it is, and doesn\\'t frame it as such.  I actually think individual therapy might be a better option for you at this point. Not because there is something wrong with you, but because having an objective person to talk these things out with can be incredibly helpful.  &gt; he thinks I\\'m being pathetic.\\n\\nThat breaks my heart. Has he said that to you directly, or something to that affect?\\n\\nYou have a very real concern, a real feeling, and it sounds like you\\'ve dealt with those feelings very maturely, at least that\\'s how your post reads. Your husband should be willing to hear you, listen to you, and take care of you throughout your marriage.\\n\\n&gt; I really don\\'t think I\\'ll ever feel the same about him.\\n\\nThings change over time. Just take care of yourself, and pay attention to whether or not you feel cared for by your partner. Is he respecting your feelings? Or is the way he\\'s treating you here, in this specific circumstance, a pattern?\\n\\nKeeping a private journal might be helpful for you, too. Feelings can be very difficult to turn into appropriate actions, and I\\'ve found that a journal really helps me with figuring out how I feel over time. Feelings and emotions are often fleeting, but if I write about them on a regular basis, I\\'m able to really gauge how I\\'ve been feeling about a particular issue over time. That helps me do the right thing for myself in the long run. \\n\\nTake care, OP. I have three pieces of advice. They\\'re all actually a bit difficult to execute, but I think your life will be much better if you:\\n\\n1. Ignore him. It is none of your business what other people think or say about you. Don\\'t worry about what Alan is saying to other people. You\\'re not the only person he has done or currently does this to. Other people likely already know that he\\'s a jerk, or will find that out in the long run. You know what you do, how much you work, and how you feel about your life. Don\\'t worry about what he or other people think. It is just noise.\\n\\n1. Don\\'t do things for other people if you expect anything in return. Now, I know you\\'re going to say, \"I didn\\'t expect anything back for cleaning up the apartment. I don\\'t ask him to help with the cost of food. I didn\\'t expect him to pay me back for the furniture. I don\\'t have expectations.\" But you do have expectations. If you don\\'t want to do these things for someone who is not your friend (which is perfectly reasonable; I wouldn\\'t want to buy furniture or food for someone or clean for someone who didn\\'t treat me with at least a normal amount of decency) - if you didn\\'t want to do those things for someone who wasn\\'t already your friend or going to remain your friend, you shouldn\\'t have done them. To that end, start asking Curt and Alan to pay for groceries. You don\\'t need to subsidize their food. You don\\'t need to clean up after them. If they\\'re total slobs, there are a variety of tactics you can use to clean only the areas of the house that you use and sequester their messes so that you can use the house as it is intended. And refrain from doing things for people in the future if you expect reciprocity. It\\'s very difficult, but I know that personally I\\'ve set up a lot of expectations for other people that were totally invisible, even to me, and that then made me resentful when issues popped up. \\n\\n1. Move if you can. I know, you redid the floors (which is a lot of work to do in a place that I presume you\\'re renting), but move either when your lease is up or sooner if possible. Take the furniture, unless Alan and/or Curt chipped in (sounds like they didn\\'t).\\n\\nTake care. Is that lady Kris Jenner? It is perfectly OK to talk to people about your relationship troubles. It is in fact very controlling of someone to punish you for doing so, particularly in this specific case because the people you confided in are entirely disconnected to your ex-girlfriend and they were not female so emotional infidelity is not at play. \\n\\nIt feels violating because she violated your privacy, and because she is trying to control your relationships with other people. \\n\\nI\\'ll tell you, my ex-boyfriend did this to me as well, and was incredibly controlling to the point of not even being OK with me having a therapist to talk to. Every trouble I had needed to go through him, he thought. This turned out to be very convenient when he started to abuse me by controlling many other aspects of my life and by eventually escalating to physical assault. Not allowing you to talk to others is often - not always, but often - an abusive tactic. At best, it\\'s manipulative.\\n\\nShe is doing you a great service by moving out. It feels very painful and difficult right now, but you didn\\'t do anything wrong. Take care of yourself and listen to yourself. You\\'re a smart guy and you know what she did was wrong. Try not to question yourself too much. Take care of yourself during the breakup, don\\'t take her back when she begs to \"fix things\" and when she apologizes and says she\\'ll never snoop again, because as much as she might mean it in the moment, she won\\'t be able to stop trying to control you unless she gets help. And I might even suggest getting a therapist to talk with about things, because it sounds like having an objective third-party to talk with might be helpful for you in general. I know it\\'s helpful for me.\\n\\nTake care. I don\\'t want to dismiss your feelings, but I would encourage you to think about what you really mean when you say that you love him. What is love to you? \\n\\nI was in a terribly abusive relationship for three years. I met a wonderful man about a year after I left my abuser and we started dating and I wanted to shout how much I loved him from the rooftops after knowing him for about four months. I couldn\\'t hold it in any longer! He made me feel so good, and he took (and still takes) such good care of me during a time that was hard. He was amazing and it felt so good to be with him. And I thought, man, I love this guy. I love him! It was eating me up inside to not say it. We\\'d fall asleep holding hands and chatting and I\\'d think, \"Just say it!\" I became obsessed with figuring out how to do it, when to do it, whether or not it would make me look too clingy or to into him... I felt like I had to say how I felt.\\n\\nI told him I loved him at the four month mark, and he very kindly said, \"I don\\'t think I know you well enough for all of that.\" And he was right. I didn\\'t know him well enough to love him yet either, but I blinded myself because it was all so so so much better than my last relationship and I was used to the word \"love\" not really meaning what it actually meant to me, which was something I hadn\\'t even really thought much about.\\n\\nSo I thought about it a bit and I decided to figure out what I want to mean when I tell someone I love them. What love means to me. And to me, love is not about feeling good. It\\'s about accepting and appreciating someone else for who they are. It\\'s about not having conditions or expectations about what that person will do for me and how they will make me feel. I didn\\'t really know my boyfriend well enough at the time to really know if I could truly accept and appreciate all of him, because I hadn\\'t seen him all yet. I still haven\\'t, and we\\'ve been dating for almost a year and a half. Just a few weeks ago I saw a new side of him, something I didn\\'t know. I\\'m still learning important things about him. \\n\\nRespectfully, I think that you feel a lot of *other* things that overlap with a feeling of love and that can be confused with love but that might not really actually be love. You\\'ve basically said that yourself: \"I love him, but I\\'m not in love with him.\" You feel a lot of different emotions now surrounding this guy, and probably also surrounding the trauma that you allude to in the first paragraph. If you just went through something intense and traumatic and met someone new who was supportive to you that was also attractive to you in other ways, it makes a lot of sense that you\\'d feel love-like feelings for them. But it is my opinion that love grows over time, and that the type of thing you\\'re experiencing is more complicated and nuanced and is probably shaded by [limerance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerence) and other emotions.\\n\\nI am going to tell you to do what I did when I was in your shoes: I got a therapist. I know, that sounds like a strange suggestion, but therapy has been wonderful for me for a lot of reasons. One big one is that abusive relationships, like ones you\\'ve been in and the one I was in, they can really warp your understanding of yourself and your feelings. Abuse makes you constantly question yourself. It makes you unsure of how to behave, because it warps your sense of human interactions to a very large degree. I found myself wanting people to tell me what to do so badly after I left my abuser; I wanted guidance and help because I did not know how to do it alone. A therapist is a very safe person to talk with about this stuff, particularly because they are an objective third party that is not involved in your life. They have no horse in the race.\\n\\nAs for what to say to this guy, tell him what you told us: \"I have been going through a lot lately, and I wanted to tell you that I am so happy that we met. You are really awesome, and I really enjoy spending time with you. You\\'re great.\" Also: If you want to be \"official\" with this guy, now would be the time to ask. \"In fact, I\\'d really like to start dating exclusively and calling you my boyfriend/have you meet my parents/put our relationship on Facebook/your definition of official here.\" Yes: You might lose him. He might say, \"Hey, I\\'m not interested in that.\" And that would be pretty crushing in the short-term. It would suck. But you know what? It beats the heck out of waiting around for six months with stars in your eyes feeling like you want to bust out with the words \"I love you\" if it turns out he\\'s not into you. I promise.\\n\\nBest of luck to you. You can\\'t \"make\" anyone understand anything. I don\\'t know what is going on in this question, but it doesn\\'t sound healthy to me. \\n\\nI think what really matters in relationships is how *you* feel. Let her worry about how she feels and you take care of how you feel. Knowing your own personality and behaviors is a great, great thing. By all means, write that down. Keep a journal because those things will change over time. But don\\'t share that with your partner.\\n\\nYou get to know someone by spending time together and seeing them in different situations. It takes more than four months. Just keep spending time together and see how it unfolds. Keep paying attention to how the relationship makes you feel. Your fourth point is really disturbing. This might sound hyperbolic, but he is sexually assaulting you. He is trying to touch you sexually when you have asked that he not do so. That is not OK and it needs to stop immediately. You have already talked to him about it and he\\'s still doing it? Who in their right mind thinks that\\'s OK? Not someone who cares about you and respects you as a person, that\\'s for sure.\\n\\nI had a boyfriend that did that to me. I talked to him about it and he ignored me. I told him to stop and he didn\\'t care. He did not understand that just because I was a woman dating him that I still had to consent to sexual activity. Every time. I had to be interested in it, and I was not interested in being groped and fondled any damn time he pleased.\\n\\nIt was really humiliating and degrading to just be existing in our house, cooking dinner for us or messing around on my computer or doing whatever, just existing like any person has the right to do, and to be expected to be open to sexual advances whenever he felt like it. Not only open, but turned on. \"Oh, honey, I just love it when I feel gassy and exhausted and you come and put your hands down my pants when I\\'m trying to make you dinner!\" said *no one ever*.\\n\\nIt was not very long before I started not being attracted to him at all, and our sex life got very bad. I started saying \"no\" to sex. Guess what someone who doesn\\'t listen to \"no\" to touching you sexually outside of the bedroom does in the bedroom? They still don\\'t listen to you saying \"no.\" After awhile I just let him do what he wanted when he wanted because saying \"no\" did nothing but make me feel bad anyhow. I did not enjoy sex any more at all with him. I left him two years ago and now I have a partner who never, ever, ever would touch me without my consent. Guess what? I don\\'t mind when he pushes up on me in the kitchen and wants to grab my chest, because he respects me and he always says, \"Is this ok?\" And I know if I said, \"No, actually, I\\'m really feeling crummy right now and I\\'m trying to cook food and I\\'m not interested in the groping right this minute,\" that he wouldn\\'t take it personally and that he would stop doing it. And it would be *fine*.\\n\\nYou can\\'t stand your fiance because he is treating you like an object, not like a human being. Changing your pill might help you regain some libido, sure, but I don\\'t think that is what this is about at all. \\n\\nTake care.\\n I went to the bathroom at a public coffee shop today. It\\'s one of those public bathrooms with a tiny sink and a mirror over it and two little stalls. People wait inside to use the bathroom; there\\'s not really a hallway in front of it. Both stalls were occupied, so I waited.\\n\\nThere\\'s another woman in there talking on the phone in one of the stalls.\\n\\nOn speakerphone. \\n\\nShe\\'s talking to someone that I presume is her boyfriend. She\\'s complaining about some \"so-called friend.\" She gets out of the stall and gives me a look: \"Ew, someone in here is *listening* to my *conversation*.\" She puts the phone on the ledge of the sink and starts doing her hair and pulls a makeup bag out of her purse.\\n\\nShe\\'s still talking on the phone when I get in the stall. I wait for her to leave.\\n\\nShe doesn\\'t leave for another ten minutes.\\n\\nI sit down and finally pee. Hooray. How rude, I think to myself. What kind of a person thinks it is acceptable to talk on speakerphone in a public bathroom?\\n\\nI go to grab some toilet paper...\\n\\nand there\\'s none left. She had taken the last bit! And of course she didn\\'t let me know so that I could grab some from the basket by the sink on my way in to the stall. She was too busy complaining on the phone. I feel like that phone would get very hot on your face inside that rubber mask. It\\'s actually incredibly common for people accused of abuse to flip the tables and call their victim the abuser. My abusive ex did this with his ex wife. I was convinced she was a horrible person until I realized that my ex was really the person who was horrible. \\n\\nBased on how he is treating you I wouldn\\'t be at all surprised if he\\'s really the perpetrator here. He\\'s blaming you now for stuff you didn\\'t do - how likely is it that he did the same and lied to you about things she did? Pretty likely. \\n\\nGo no contact, take care of yourself, and try to go more slowly in relationships in the future. People show their true colors over time. Sorry his is a shade of asshole.  &gt; A room full of overly extroverted people doing those group challenges where everyone has to say their name while dancing or some shit.\\n\\nI once had to tell \"two truths and a lie\" while meeting people for the first time in college. My truths were my name and my age, and my lie was \"I love playing name games like this one when I\\'m meeting people.\"  Where can I buy these? I love them!! I think paying a medical bill for a puggle in need (or other animal) is a great idea!  My boyfriend and I get along very well, but he does not love me. I told him I loved him a year ago and he broke up with me about two weeks later abruptly and with no explanation. Later he told me it was because he did not love me and he felt like I was moving too fast. We got back together after four days and a lot of communication that should have happened before the breakup but did not. \\n\\nOur communication has improved but sometimes is still strained. He still does not love me. About six months ago we were having a serious discussion and he said that he really liked and respected me. I said, \"But you don\\'t love me, right?\" We then talked more and he told me he only wants to tell people that he is sure he wants to be with forever that he loves them. He said he always told past girlfriends (I don\\'t know how many serious girlfriends he has had, I think around 3; this is something he just doesn\\'t get into at all with me) that he loves them and not really felt it and he didn\\'t want to do that anymore. I fully agree with that in theory. \\n\\nBut in practice it kind of hurts that he doesn\\'t love me. I don\\'t feel certain about a lifetime with him by any means - but I can see continuing our very good relationship for at least several years. Also, when is anyone really fully certain? I think that marriage is something you can only ever be reasonably certain of. \\n\\nHe also told me that he has tried to figure out what love feels like by asking people and they always say \"You can\\'t imagine life without them\" and he says he can\\'t imagine ever feeling that way about another person. He says it sounds unhealthy. Again, theoretically I agree - but emotionally I understand that feeling. I can\\'t imagine life without the people I\\'ve loved - even if they are no longer close to me -because they fundamentally shaped and changed me. And because they\\'ve become part of my everyday fabric and I like having them there. \\n\\nAnyhow, I\\'m not sure what to do with all this. I don\\'t really care about having children (I can\\'t and don\\'t want to anyhow) so that\\'s not a concern. It\\'s just that when I think of how long it has been since I felt loved romantically by someone (my last boyfriend abused me for three relentless years) I get really, really sad.  I\\'m this person\\'s height (4\\'11\") and I do this all the time. Without shoes on. And then I sterilize the counter. A chair isn\\'t tall enough for shorties to reach the top shelf!\\n\\n(I am not 12 years old, and I suspect the girl in the photograph is not as well.) It\\'s ok to break up with someone for any reason or no reason at all. You can break up with someone even if you love them if the relationship doesn\\'t work for you. You have this Internet stranger\\'s permission to do what you want to do here. \\n\\nTry to be compassionate when you do it. The old \"it\\'s not you it\\'s me\" but much softer: \"Clara, I know we have had good times together. But right now I have a lot of work to do on myself. I need to figure myself out and I need to do it alone while single. You\\'re a wonderful woman and I love you but I can\\'t be in a relationship with you.\"\\n\\nThen move, if you live together, and take some time to yourself to recover from the relationship. Even if you aren\\'t attracted to her anymore you will probably miss her. Take some time to learn who you are again \\n\\nGood luck. You can do this.  That \"someone\" was wrong. Being able to spend time alone and loving someone are not mutually exclusive. I would go crazy if I didn\\'t have time apart from my boyfriend. We recently spent three days together and I was so ready to spend some time alone after that! He is also really into spending time alone, and when we met and he told me that I was thrilled.\\n\\nThere are people out there who value their alone time just as much as you do. Instead of lying, try to be honest with your next girlfriend. Tell her upfront that you need your alone time. That will weed out the people who don\\'t understand and help you build a workable relationship with someone that understands you and respects this need.  You look great! So much more confident and happy. I love your hair, too - it\\'s so shiny. :) Oh, I had a boyfriend like this. He wasn\\'t even satisfied when I weighed 88 pounds and was starving myself.\\n\\nYour husband is being extraordinarily selfish. Like, seriously privileged and selfish. Tell him to grow the fuck up or to get out of your house. This list of [questions couples should ask before marriage](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/17/fashion/weddings/17FIELDBOX.html) published in the New York Times is pretty great. Lots of things to consider.  The \"sweetest guy in the world\" would keep this thought to himself.  There\\'s a difference between honesty and cruelty.  I wax for myself. My boyfriend could not care less what i do with my pubic hair.\\n\\nWaxing hurts less the more you do it. If you go regularly, you really will get used to it. The first time I went I was in a lot of pain, but now I can\\'t miss an appointment because I love it so much and the pain is minimal and worth it. You know the answer. It\\'s because he\\'s a jerk who doesn\\'t care about your feelings. No, really. That\\'s really what this is about. Trust your gut and dump this guy. You\\'re going to find a man who does not pull this kind of ridiculous shit, and you\\'ll look back on this wanker and laugh someday. Why are you guys talking about this? You shouldn\\'t know what \"number\" your boyfriend thinks you are. Your boyfriend shouldn\\'t be rating you on a scale, even if you ask.\\n\\nI\\'m not a 10/10. I know it. I know that I\\'m not the hottest woman in the world; heck, I\\'m reasonably sure that I\\'m not the most attractive woman that my current boyfriend has ever dated. But we don\\'t talk about that. Why would we? He chooses to be with me and that\\'s enough. \\n\\nDating is not about looks. It\\'s not about the way you look. Sure, you want to be sexually attracted to your partner. But that\\'s not the only thing that matters, and frankly, your appearance? It\\'s really pretty low on the scale of things that matter in a partner - especially as you age.\\n\\nDon\\'t stand for guys that tell you your number. Don\\'t ask them your number. Just stay away from the topic. The boyfriend that I did have that let me know that he thought I was a 4 hurt me so much - there\\'s no reason to talk about that stuff. No reason for him to bring that up to me. Now, he was abusive and mean and he wanted to tell me I was a 4 to hurt my feelings and to make me feel bad - and because he was a relentless jerk and he really saw me as a \"4\". Now, my nice, kind, caring boyfriend? He treats me like the hottest woman in the world. And I know I\\'m not, and he knows I\\'m not, but he sees me as a beautiful woman because he cares for all of me. Not just my face and my body. He likes my brain; he likes the way I cook; he likes that I have hobbies I care about. He likes how I relate to other people. He likes ME. Not my body, not my face. Me.\\n You are in a relationship with him as he is right now, not with him as he might be later if he happens to change.\\n\\nThis is the hardest lesson I\\'ve ever had to learn, but if you don\\'t want to be in the relationship you are in, right now, for the rest of your life, with the man you are with as he is right now - assume he will never change, most people don\\'t - it\\'s time to walk away.  Truth. * obsessed with fetch\\n* begs for food like she\\'s deprived of proper meals (she\\'s not, trust me)\\n* sleeps on back of the couch\\n* very well-behaved (won\\'t eat the cat\\'s food, which is always out, even when left home alone - after being yelled at for trying it once!)\\n* knows words (my name, her name, food, puggle, hungry, ball, outside, bed)\\n* barks at the mail man and delivery men\\n* chews her bone for about an hour after I or my boyfriend walk in the door after work - after an enthusiastic greeting, of course\\n* sleeps under the covers\\n* always underfoot \\n* always needs to be touching everyone\\n* will lick anything in her path\\n* did I mention she\\'s obsessed with fetch?

Actually, I think you\\'re in the wrong here. Your girlfriend wasn\\'t outright rude, and it is your job to be honest with your mom about stuff. You lied to your mom and now your girlfriend is rightly upset.\\n\\n\"The only thing my mom wanted was a legitimate thank you.\"\\n\\nWell, she couldn\\'t possibly get this. Your girlfriend couldn\\'t give a legitimate thank you - she didn\\'t want this thing and you didn\\'t express that at all to your family. This one is on you.\\n\\nWith your next girlfriend, work on better communication.\\n\\nAlso I would not be down with my boyfriend\\'s mom showing up at my place while I was still asleep. It sounds like you\\'re really involved with your parents still. It\\'s going to be difficult for you to find a woman who is OK with how involved your mom is in your (and by extension, her) life.'",

      "\u001b[0;31mValueError\u001b[0m: could not convert string to float: 'A decent salad at a non-chain restaurant. No dessert, though. three horse head emojis in a row. I had a friend [41F] who went through a bad breakup. After two years, she was still *very* upset about it. Since we both went through bad breakups at the same time (mine from a physically, verbally, and emotionally abusive man who I lived with for three years), we were very supportive of one another initially, and even moved in together as roommates - but I got over my breakup and she did not. She would want to talk about her ex and what had happened with them for hours and hours at a time, whenever she wanted to do it, and since we lived together I had little escape from listening to her re-hash the situation and talk about how painful it was - years later. She even compared her relationship to mine, which was exceedingly abusive, and said I was \"lucky\" because my ex had moved out of town and hers, who was not abusive, had not. Her breakup was confusing - her ex just basically dropped her out of the blue and never spoke to her again - so I can understand why it was a difficult thing for her, but still... needing to talk for hours after years? With someone who isn\\'t your therapist?\\n\\nAt a certain point (after about eight months of being regaled with tales of her ex on a very regular - biweekly to monthly - basis), I told her I wasn\\'t helping her anymore and that I didn\\'t want to talk about it. In truth, I was very upset that she felt like she could interrupt me any time, often when I was working (I work a lot from home because I have a demanding job), and frankly? Her issues were not getting better. I\\'m not a therapist and I could not help her anymore. She claimed I was wrong, that she wasn\\'t talking about her ex at all, and then curbed her behavior a bit. In response, I started keeping a private log of times she did talk about her ex with me, and how long it went on for, because I felt like maybe I was going crazy. \\n\\nUnfortunately, there were still many situations where she would corner me and \"need\" to talk for hours at a time. This happened on a monthly basis instead of bi-weekly. She would apologize for \"wasting my time\" but she didn\\'t seem to understand that she was breaking a boundary by doing this. It came to a head when she called me while I was at work one day because she saw a person that looked like her ex. Just someone who looked like her ex - not her ex. That made me very angry, because it derailed my work for several hours - mostly because I was fuming that she had called for what, frankly, was to me a very ridiculous thing.  \\n\\nI told her that I no longer wanted a friendship with her because she had violated my boundaries too many times (actually, I used \"I\" language, and said \"I have trouble maintaining firm boundaries with you\"). She responded by saying that actually *I* violated *her* boundaries because I had a perception that she was breaking my boundaries when she really wasn\\'t, and that she couldn\\'t handle me telling her to stop stepping on my personal boundaries when she wasn\\'t doing it and hadn\\'t ever talked about her ex to me *at all*. Do I not understand boundaries? Or am I OK? Is it possible to break someone\\'s boundaries by telling them that they are stepping on your own? You shouldn\\'t need to convince. I think you can say exactly what you said here: \"I\\'m uncomfortable spending so much on going out to eat together. I\\'d love to take you out sometimes, my treat, but not as often as we\\'ve been going out.\"\\n\\nYou also might consider seeing if she wants to learn how to cook a new cuisine together. My boyfriend and I used to eat all our meals out, and now we make most of them together at home. Get a bottle of wine, some crushed tomatoes, an onion, and spaghetti, and make a romantic dinner. Make meatballs, too, if you\\'re feeling like you\\'re up for more of a challenge. Drink the wine while you\\'re cooking, but save some for dinner. It\\'s a blast, it\\'s less expensive, and you\\'re learning something new and fun together, which can definitely strengthen the relationship. My advice for you is to take care of yourself. That is the best thing you can do right now, both for yourself and for her.\\n\\nYou don\\'t need to make any decisions right now. Just keep asking yourself how you feel about your relationship with her. This is the relationship that you have right now, unfortunately - one that is just texting. She sounds like she is not ready to be in a relationship. She can\\'t be a partner and she isn\\'t able to do it right now.\\n\\nSee how you feel in two weeks, in a month, in two months. Take care of yourself. Is there a hobby that you\\'ve always been interested in starting? Now would be a great time to pick that hobby up. \\n\\nTake care. She told me that my \"misperception\" of her talking about her ex to me - saying she was doing it when she claims she wasn\\'t - was what violated her boundaries. \\n\\nI do think that in her mind she never talks about her ex, because she wants to talk about her ex *all the time*. I think she\\'s thinking of her ex constantly. Every object and every thing she did had some kind of connection to her ex, however tenuous. So every day that goes by where she doesn\\'t verbally mention the ex probably stands out to her in her mind much more saliently than the moments where she does talk of them.\\n\\nAnyhow, thanks to everyone for the comments. I feel a bit better knowing that the only \"boundary\" I\\'ve stepped on here is the one where she wants her friends to be her therapist. Thankfully, we were never married. I was in an abusive relationship for three years. My ex checked all those boxes as well when we first started dating. It did eventually escalate and get physical. But that doesn\\'t even matter. One thing I learned from my abusive relationship is that a person doesn\\'t have to be abusive to make it OK to not want to be with them. \\n\\nI\\'ll say that again: A person does not have to be abusive to make it OK to not want to be with them.\\n\\nYou say \"I don\\'t know how to feel\" here but I think you know how you feel - you just don\\'t know what to *do* with those feelings. Here are some of the things you\\'re feeling, based on the words you used in your post:\\n\\n* You\\'re going to college and don\\'t want to have an LDR\\n* You feel pressured to do things physically that you\\'re not comfortable with\\n* You feel tired of enforcing your boundaries\\n* You feel confused that you have to keep reinforcing your boundaries with him\\n* You feel compromised and violated\\n* You don\\'t feel like you want to marry this guy\\n* You feel like he\\'s blaming you when he crosses your clear boundaries\\n\\nMy advice? Stop seeing this guy. You say he is your best friend, but friends don\\'t treat one another this way.\\n\\nTake care. The first thing you should do is call the domestic violence hotline at 1-800-799-7233. They can do a number of things, including: listen to you vent, help you come up with a safety plan, and connect you with a shelter in your area.\\n\\nI know that the words \"domestic violence\" and \"abuse\" are not pleasant to even consider. I have been in a similar situation and it was very difficult for me to come to terms with the word \"abuse.\" The first time I called the DV hotline, I felt ridiculous. Like I wasn\\'t worthy of using up their time with my silly difficult relationship, which surely wasn\\'t abusive because he hadn\\'t hit me. Yet.\\n\\nBut I\\'m so glad I called. I left that man two years ago and my life is so much better. It was hard to get to this point, but the support that I got from my local women\\'s shelter was vital to me and helped me escape a very bad situation with a bad guy.\\n\\nWhile you think about calling them, try to do things to take care of yourself. Go on a walk. Take a hot bath. Paint your fingernails. Make a nice dinner. But it will be very hard to feel complete and whole and genuinely *good* - it will be very difficult to perform routine self-care - if your \"partner\" (I put this in quotes because this doesn\\'t sound like a partnership to me) is someone who treats you like garbage. I know this from personal experience.\\n\\nEven though he is controlling and difficult and makes your life very, very hard, you still probably love him and care for him. It might be hard to even think of him as abusive. And that\\'s OK. The DV hotline can help you identify whether or not it is abusive (I certainly think it is from where I\\'m standing, but that doesn\\'t matter much) and how to get out if it is. One thing that helped me as I made my way towards leaving my abuser was coming to terms with this truth: The only way to help someone like this is to leave them. Furthermore, you aren\\'t breaking a vow or a pact if you do leave. Divorce is serious, but marriage means that you *both* take care of one another and support one another. He\\'s not holding up his end of the deal by behaving this way.\\n\\nTake care, and good luck. It sounds to me like it might be helpful for you to work on slowing down in the future. This type of thing is very common if you become infatuated at first sight, like you did here. Infatuation, or [limerance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerence), can blind us.\\n\\nOne thing I like to do when I am seeing someone new is I take up a new hobby at the same time. This helps me focus on myself and on things I enjoy at the same time that I\\'m meeting someone new. It keeps me from getting infatuated.\\n\\nNo one is perfect, and love takes a long time to develop. I think that there are some situations where \"love at first sight\" happens, sure, but I think that there\\'s never anything wrong with going slowly. If it\\'s real love, it will work - if it\\'s not, protecting yourself and not getting too invested too soon can help you from feeling devastated when it doesn\\'t work out.\\n\\nTake care. It\\'s always hard when someone we thought we really liked turns out to be a different person than we imagined.  This is a scary conversation to have with your partner, because it\\'s kind or make-or-break. I understand. Still, you have laid it out very well here in a clear fashion. You can tell him essentially what you told us:\\n\\n&gt;I feel very serious about you. We share a similar sense of humor, we have similar intellect, and we get along very well in general, aside from having a romantic feelings as well. I\\'ve never had feelings for someone like this before and I feel incredibly vulnerable. I want to talk about making a step forward in our relationship. What do you think about making a more formal committment to one another? If you want some time to think about this before we talk about it, that\\'s totally fine.\\n\\nIt\\'s scary but it is honest and opens the lines of communication. \\n\\nGood luck. You\\'re strong and you can initiate this conversation with him.  I had a boyfriend like your wife. I spent so much time asking this question. \\n\\nThe only answer was not one I wanted to face: you can\\'t change other people, even if it is for the better. It was not within my power as a human to change him into a non-abusive man. This is a cold, hard reality: people cannot be changed unless they change themselves. \\n\\nA lot of the things you say are textbook examples of domestic violence, I am sorry to say, including:\\n\\n* Controlling your personal relationships\\n* Micromanaging your time\\n* Outbursts of anger over slight infarctions related to her preferences (e.g. having her dinner ready on time)\\n* Not allowing you to initiate sex\\n* Blaming you for the problems and taking zero ownership for any issues\\n* Hitting you\\n* Refusing to get help because she refuses to admit she has any problems\\n\\nIt took me years to come to terms with the fact that this was domestic violence, and my boyfriend was an abusive person. And that I couldn\\'t make it stop while also staying with him. \\n\\nThe only way to make it stop is to leave. I know you have a child and that makes things much much harder. Please consider calling the domestic violence hotline, or contacting a local domestic violence center to talk about a safety plan for you and your child. \"Women\\'s\" shelters will also help you. DV does not just happen to women. \\n\\nI\\'m sorry you\\'re going through this. Take care of yourself.  If you have to ask a question that has this much text about another human?\\n\\nYour relationship with said other human is over. \\n\\nI know that might sound a bit hyperbolic, but no one - no one - is worth this much angst and storm and stress. \\n\\nExtricate yourself from this \"friendship\" and go have a drink or a hot bath. You deserve it.  This question is too vague to answer. \\n\\nThat said, the book:\\n\\n[How to be an Adult in Relationships: The Five Keys to Mindful Loving](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1570628122)\\n\\nhas been a very helpful text for me. It has a snarky title, but it\\'s a very useful book.  You need to address the real issue with her. Why were you on OKC? You might have to sit down and really think about the answer to that question.\\n\\nYou have both broken trust here: you for keeping an OKC account open, and her for reading your phone. What kept you from trusting her enough to enough to either delete your OKC account, or to tell her you were keeping it open? And what made her distrust you enough to look at your phone?\\n\\nTrust is earned. You can both start rebuilding it by talking about this stuff. \\n\\n I\\'m 4\\'11\" and I lost 30 pounds 4 years ago, got from 127 to 97 - I know you feel fabulous. Nice work!!! It\\'s so much harder when you\\'re a shortie like we are. :) You should never be in a relationship where someone keeps you a secret. You deserve better than that. Everyone does.\\n\\nI am an insecure person as well, just generally and in romantic relationships. Dating someone who highlighted my insecurities and made me feel crazy only made me more insecure. It was a feedback loop of sorts and fed on itself. I don\\'t recommend it.\\n\\nTake care of yourself. It is OK to feel the way that you feel. Take care of your feelings and give them a voice here. You are not wrong to feel insecure in a relationship that is being kept a secret.  Being in a secret relationship was very isolating for me. I had no one I could share my relationship joys or troubles with except for him. These conditions made it very easy for him to abuse and control me - secretiveness about our relationship was the first red flag.\\n\\nWhat made me leave him was him starting to bring physical violence in to the emotionally and verbally abusive relationship he had created. \\n\\nBut even aside from the abuse, being kept secret made me insecure for many reasons. It made me question why he was hiding me - was there something about me he was ashamed of? Was I not pretty enough or cool enough for him? It made me feel small. It made me feel insignificant: he was a big part of my life, but I was only a minor character in his. It made me feel left out and ignored. \\n\\nBut mostly, for me, it created conditions that were ripe for abuse and control. I worked so hard to be good enough for him to want to shout his love for me from the rooftops. Instead of asking myself: \"Is this man good enough for me?\" I was merely asking \"Am I good enough for him?\" - which is the wrong question to ask in a relationship. \\n\\nRelationships should not make you question yourself at that level for that long. They should prop you up, not pull you down.  She\\'s being very controlling. No one should *unlock the bathroom door* to see what their partner is doing in there. That\\'s very controlling behavior, and you\\'ll be better off with someone who doesn\\'t try to police your sexuality like that. \\n\\nSometimes you just want to masturbate and not have sex, and that\\'s totally fine. People masturbate. If she wants to date someone who doesn\\'t, she\\'ll need to find someone else with a low sex drive or someone who likes being sexually controlled. Not you. You two just have fundamentally mismatched ways of being in the world.\\n\\nPersonally, I\\'d never date someone who wouldn\\'t \"let\" me masturbate (it\\'s my body!) so I\\'m biased. You should date someone who also doesn\\'t care about this.  Yes also: make sure it\\'s not the placebo pills she is skipping. Those are usually a different color and are in the last row of the package. Skipping a placebo is fine - they\\'re just there so that you don\\'t forget to stay on schedule when the pack runs out.  So, the last four pills in the package in the medicine cabinet - that\\'s OK. You don\\'t yet have evidence that she has actually skipped her birth control.\\n\\nI\\'d just ask her: Hey, I saw this in the medicine cabinet. Are you still taking your birth control, or is there something you need to talk with me about? Here\\'s the thing: relationships rely on communication. Y\\'all have to be able to communicate.\\n\\nYou can\\'t seem to communicate with one another. She\\'s talking to him, and you\\'re talking to us. You need to talk to each other.\\n\\nIt sounds like you have tried to talk with her and she\\'s not communicating back. That\\'s a dealbreaker. I am so sorry. You might try talking with her again. Perhaps suggest couples counseling so that you can work together on your communicating. Tell her what you told us. You don\\'t sound jealous or rude or controlling - you sound like someone who has some legitimate fears and concerns about a relationship that is very important to them. Concerned enough that you\\'ve snooped on your girlfriend\\'s phone.\\n\\nIf y\\'all can\\'t talk, this won\\'t work. Best of luck to you. &gt; I know that abuse is defined by whether or not someone feels abused\\n\\nNo, that\\'s not right. Abuse is a systematic and sustained effort to control another person. It\\'s a repeated pattern of events where the victim feels unsafe (\"walking on eggshells\") and unable to set boundaries or engage in other normal human behaviors for fear of being abused verbally, emotionally, sexually, and/or physically. \\n\\nIf you are concerned you are abusive, the best thing you can do for yourself is to get a therapist. That might be helpful either way, because you sound quite gummed up about this whole thing. Having an objective third party to talk with I think will prove very useful for you. \\n\\nBest of luck to you. Take care.  The best relationship advice I have is this: be accepting of your partner. Appreciate them for being themselves. Allow them to be themselves, and give them space to flourish and to be their best self. Pay attention to your partner, and show them affection in a way they can understand. If these things are difficult, communicate about those difficulties. \\n\\nDo the same things for yourself: accept yourself for who you are, allow yourself the space to be yourself, pay attention to how you feel and what you\\'re doing, appreciate yourself and the gifts you bring to the world, and show yourself affection by being kind to yourself and taking care of yourself. \\n\\nEasier said than done, of course, but these five words will unlock human relationships for you: accepting, appreciating, affection, allowing, and acceptance.  This person is referring to a twitter hashtag used by survivors of domestic violence to talk about why they stayed in abusive relationships. \\n\\nI don\\'t think we have enough information to say anything about whether or not this situation is abusive, though. The OP certainly doesn\\'t think it is, and doesn\\'t frame it as such.  I actually think individual therapy might be a better option for you at this point. Not because there is something wrong with you, but because having an objective person to talk these things out with can be incredibly helpful.  &gt; he thinks I\\'m being pathetic.\\n\\nThat breaks my heart. Has he said that to you directly, or something to that affect?\\n\\nYou have a very real concern, a real feeling, and it sounds like you\\'ve dealt with those feelings very maturely, at least that\\'s how your post reads. Your husband should be willing to hear you, listen to you, and take care of you throughout your marriage.\\n\\n&gt; I really don\\'t think I\\'ll ever feel the same about him.\\n\\nThings change over time. Just take care of yourself, and pay attention to whether or not you feel cared for by your partner. Is he respecting your feelings? Or is the way he\\'s treating you here, in this specific circumstance, a pattern?\\n\\nKeeping a private journal might be helpful for you, too. Feelings can be very difficult to turn into appropriate actions, and I\\'ve found that a journal really helps me with figuring out how I feel over time. Feelings and emotions are often fleeting, but if I write about them on a regular basis, I\\'m able to really gauge how I\\'ve been feeling about a particular issue over time. That helps me do the right thing for myself in the long run. \\n\\nTake care, OP. I have three pieces of advice. They\\'re all actually a bit difficult to execute, but I think your life will be much better if you:\\n\\n1. Ignore him. It is none of your business what other people think or say about you. Don\\'t worry about what Alan is saying to other people. You\\'re not the only person he has done or currently does this to. Other people likely already know that he\\'s a jerk, or will find that out in the long run. You know what you do, how much you work, and how you feel about your life. Don\\'t worry about what he or other people think. It is just noise.\\n\\n1. Don\\'t do things for other people if you expect anything in return. Now, I know you\\'re going to say, \"I didn\\'t expect anything back for cleaning up the apartment. I don\\'t ask him to help with the cost of food. I didn\\'t expect him to pay me back for the furniture. I don\\'t have expectations.\" But you do have expectations. If you don\\'t want to do these things for someone who is not your friend (which is perfectly reasonable; I wouldn\\'t want to buy furniture or food for someone or clean for someone who didn\\'t treat me with at least a normal amount of decency) - if you didn\\'t want to do those things for someone who wasn\\'t already your friend or going to remain your friend, you shouldn\\'t have done them. To that end, start asking Curt and Alan to pay for groceries. You don\\'t need to subsidize their food. You don\\'t need to clean up after them. If they\\'re total slobs, there are a variety of tactics you can use to clean only the areas of the house that you use and sequester their messes so that you can use the house as it is intended. And refrain from doing things for people in the future if you expect reciprocity. It\\'s very difficult, but I know that personally I\\'ve set up a lot of expectations for other people that were totally invisible, even to me, and that then made me resentful when issues popped up. \\n\\n1. Move if you can. I know, you redid the floors (which is a lot of work to do in a place that I presume you\\'re renting), but move either when your lease is up or sooner if possible. Take the furniture, unless Alan and/or Curt chipped in (sounds like they didn\\'t).\\n\\nTake care. Is that lady Kris Jenner? It is perfectly OK to talk to people about your relationship troubles. It is in fact very controlling of someone to punish you for doing so, particularly in this specific case because the people you confided in are entirely disconnected to your ex-girlfriend and they were not female so emotional infidelity is not at play. \\n\\nIt feels violating because she violated your privacy, and because she is trying to control your relationships with other people. \\n\\nI\\'ll tell you, my ex-boyfriend did this to me as well, and was incredibly controlling to the point of not even being OK with me having a therapist to talk to. Every trouble I had needed to go through him, he thought. This turned out to be very convenient when he started to abuse me by controlling many other aspects of my life and by eventually escalating to physical assault. Not allowing you to talk to others is often - not always, but often - an abusive tactic. At best, it\\'s manipulative.\\n\\nShe is doing you a great service by moving out. It feels very painful and difficult right now, but you didn\\'t do anything wrong. Take care of yourself and listen to yourself. You\\'re a smart guy and you know what she did was wrong. Try not to question yourself too much. Take care of yourself during the breakup, don\\'t take her back when she begs to \"fix things\" and when she apologizes and says she\\'ll never snoop again, because as much as she might mean it in the moment, she won\\'t be able to stop trying to control you unless she gets help. And I might even suggest getting a therapist to talk with about things, because it sounds like having an objective third-party to talk with might be helpful for you in general. I know it\\'s helpful for me.\\n\\nTake care. I don\\'t want to dismiss your feelings, but I would encourage you to think about what you really mean when you say that you love him. What is love to you? \\n\\nI was in a terribly abusive relationship for three years. I met a wonderful man about a year after I left my abuser and we started dating and I wanted to shout how much I loved him from the rooftops after knowing him for about four months. I couldn\\'t hold it in any longer! He made me feel so good, and he took (and still takes) such good care of me during a time that was hard. He was amazing and it felt so good to be with him. And I thought, man, I love this guy. I love him! It was eating me up inside to not say it. We\\'d fall asleep holding hands and chatting and I\\'d think, \"Just say it!\" I became obsessed with figuring out how to do it, when to do it, whether or not it would make me look too clingy or to into him... I felt like I had to say how I felt.\\n\\nI told him I loved him at the four month mark, and he very kindly said, \"I don\\'t think I know you well enough for all of that.\" And he was right. I didn\\'t know him well enough to love him yet either, but I blinded myself because it was all so so so much better than my last relationship and I was used to the word \"love\" not really meaning what it actually meant to me, which was something I hadn\\'t even really thought much about.\\n\\nSo I thought about it a bit and I decided to figure out what I want to mean when I tell someone I love them. What love means to me. And to me, love is not about feeling good. It\\'s about accepting and appreciating someone else for who they are. It\\'s about not having conditions or expectations about what that person will do for me and how they will make me feel. I didn\\'t really know my boyfriend well enough at the time to really know if I could truly accept and appreciate all of him, because I hadn\\'t seen him all yet. I still haven\\'t, and we\\'ve been dating for almost a year and a half. Just a few weeks ago I saw a new side of him, something I didn\\'t know. I\\'m still learning important things about him. \\n\\nRespectfully, I think that you feel a lot of *other* things that overlap with a feeling of love and that can be confused with love but that might not really actually be love. You\\'ve basically said that yourself: \"I love him, but I\\'m not in love with him.\" You feel a lot of different emotions now surrounding this guy, and probably also surrounding the trauma that you allude to in the first paragraph. If you just went through something intense and traumatic and met someone new who was supportive to you that was also attractive to you in other ways, it makes a lot of sense that you\\'d feel love-like feelings for them. But it is my opinion that love grows over time, and that the type of thing you\\'re experiencing is more complicated and nuanced and is probably shaded by [limerance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerence) and other emotions.\\n\\nI am going to tell you to do what I did when I was in your shoes: I got a therapist. I know, that sounds like a strange suggestion, but therapy has been wonderful for me for a lot of reasons. One big one is that abusive relationships, like ones you\\'ve been in and the one I was in, they can really warp your understanding of yourself and your feelings. Abuse makes you constantly question yourself. It makes you unsure of how to behave, because it warps your sense of human interactions to a very large degree. I found myself wanting people to tell me what to do so badly after I left my abuser; I wanted guidance and help because I did not know how to do it alone. A therapist is a very safe person to talk with about this stuff, particularly because they are an objective third party that is not involved in your life. They have no horse in the race.\\n\\nAs for what to say to this guy, tell him what you told us: \"I have been going through a lot lately, and I wanted to tell you that I am so happy that we met. You are really awesome, and I really enjoy spending time with you. You\\'re great.\" Also: If you want to be \"official\" with this guy, now would be the time to ask. \"In fact, I\\'d really like to start dating exclusively and calling you my boyfriend/have you meet my parents/put our relationship on Facebook/your definition of official here.\" Yes: You might lose him. He might say, \"Hey, I\\'m not interested in that.\" And that would be pretty crushing in the short-term. It would suck. But you know what? It beats the heck out of waiting around for six months with stars in your eyes feeling like you want to bust out with the words \"I love you\" if it turns out he\\'s not into you. I promise.\\n\\nBest of luck to you. You can\\'t \"make\" anyone understand anything. I don\\'t know what is going on in this question, but it doesn\\'t sound healthy to me. \\n\\nI think what really matters in relationships is how *you* feel. Let her worry about how she feels and you take care of how you feel. Knowing your own personality and behaviors is a great, great thing. By all means, write that down. Keep a journal because those things will change over time. But don\\'t share that with your partner.\\n\\nYou get to know someone by spending time together and seeing them in different situations. It takes more than four months. Just keep spending time together and see how it unfolds. Keep paying attention to how the relationship makes you feel. Your fourth point is really disturbing. This might sound hyperbolic, but he is sexually assaulting you. He is trying to touch you sexually when you have asked that he not do so. That is not OK and it needs to stop immediately. You have already talked to him about it and he\\'s still doing it? Who in their right mind thinks that\\'s OK? Not someone who cares about you and respects you as a person, that\\'s for sure.\\n\\nI had a boyfriend that did that to me. I talked to him about it and he ignored me. I told him to stop and he didn\\'t care. He did not understand that just because I was a woman dating him that I still had to consent to sexual activity. Every time. I had to be interested in it, and I was not interested in being groped and fondled any damn time he pleased.\\n\\nIt was really humiliating and degrading to just be existing in our house, cooking dinner for us or messing around on my computer or doing whatever, just existing like any person has the right to do, and to be expected to be open to sexual advances whenever he felt like it. Not only open, but turned on. \"Oh, honey, I just love it when I feel gassy and exhausted and you come and put your hands down my pants when I\\'m trying to make you dinner!\" said *no one ever*.\\n\\nIt was not very long before I started not being attracted to him at all, and our sex life got very bad. I started saying \"no\" to sex. Guess what someone who doesn\\'t listen to \"no\" to touching you sexually outside of the bedroom does in the bedroom? They still don\\'t listen to you saying \"no.\" After awhile I just let him do what he wanted when he wanted because saying \"no\" did nothing but make me feel bad anyhow. I did not enjoy sex any more at all with him. I left him two years ago and now I have a partner who never, ever, ever would touch me without my consent. Guess what? I don\\'t mind when he pushes up on me in the kitchen and wants to grab my chest, because he respects me and he always says, \"Is this ok?\" And I know if I said, \"No, actually, I\\'m really feeling crummy right now and I\\'m trying to cook food and I\\'m not interested in the groping right this minute,\" that he wouldn\\'t take it personally and that he would stop doing it. And it would be *fine*.\\n\\nYou can\\'t stand your fiance because he is treating you like an object, not like a human being. Changing your pill might help you regain some libido, sure, but I don\\'t think that is what this is about at all. \\n\\nTake care.\\n I went to the bathroom at a public coffee shop today. It\\'s one of those public bathrooms with a tiny sink and a mirror over it and two little stalls. People wait inside to use the bathroom; there\\'s not really a hallway in front of it. Both stalls were occupied, so I waited.\\n\\nThere\\'s another woman in there talking on the phone in one of the stalls.\\n\\nOn speakerphone. \\n\\nShe\\'s talking to someone that I presume is her boyfriend. She\\'s complaining about some \"so-called friend.\" She gets out of the stall and gives me a look: \"Ew, someone in here is *listening* to my *conversation*.\" She puts the phone on the ledge of the sink and starts doing her hair and pulls a makeup bag out of her purse.\\n\\nShe\\'s still talking on the phone when I get in the stall. I wait for her to leave.\\n\\nShe doesn\\'t leave for another ten minutes.\\n\\nI sit down and finally pee. Hooray. How rude, I think to myself. What kind of a person thinks it is acceptable to talk on speakerphone in a public bathroom?\\n\\nI go to grab some toilet paper...\\n\\nand there\\'s none left. She had taken the last bit! And of course she didn\\'t let me know so that I could grab some from the basket by the sink on my way in to the stall. She was too busy complaining on the phone. I feel like that phone would get very hot on your face inside that rubber mask. It\\'s actually incredibly common for people accused of abuse to flip the tables and call their victim the abuser. My abusive ex did this with his ex wife. I was convinced she was a horrible person until I realized that my ex was really the person who was horrible. \\n\\nBased on how he is treating you I wouldn\\'t be at all surprised if he\\'s really the perpetrator here. He\\'s blaming you now for stuff you didn\\'t do - how likely is it that he did the same and lied to you about things she did? Pretty likely. \\n\\nGo no contact, take care of yourself, and try to go more slowly in relationships in the future. People show their true colors over time. Sorry his is a shade of asshole.  &gt; A room full of overly extroverted people doing those group challenges where everyone has to say their name while dancing or some shit.\\n\\nI once had to tell \"two truths and a lie\" while meeting people for the first time in college. My truths were my name and my age, and my lie was \"I love playing name games like this one when I\\'m meeting people.\"  Where can I buy these? I love them!! I think paying a medical bill for a puggle in need (or other animal) is a great idea!  My boyfriend and I get along very well, but he does not love me. I told him I loved him a year ago and he broke up with me about two weeks later abruptly and with no explanation. Later he told me it was because he did not love me and he felt like I was moving too fast. We got back together after four days and a lot of communication that should have happened before the breakup but did not. \\n\\nOur communication has improved but sometimes is still strained. He still does not love me. About six months ago we were having a serious discussion and he said that he really liked and respected me. I said, \"But you don\\'t love me, right?\" We then talked more and he told me he only wants to tell people that he is sure he wants to be with forever that he loves them. He said he always told past girlfriends (I don\\'t know how many serious girlfriends he has had, I think around 3; this is something he just doesn\\'t get into at all with me) that he loves them and not really felt it and he didn\\'t want to do that anymore. I fully agree with that in theory. \\n\\nBut in practice it kind of hurts that he doesn\\'t love me. I don\\'t feel certain about a lifetime with him by any means - but I can see continuing our very good relationship for at least several years. Also, when is anyone really fully certain? I think that marriage is something you can only ever be reasonably certain of. \\n\\nHe also told me that he has tried to figure out what love feels like by asking people and they always say \"You can\\'t imagine life without them\" and he says he can\\'t imagine ever feeling that way about another person. He says it sounds unhealthy. Again, theoretically I agree - but emotionally I understand that feeling. I can\\'t imagine life without the people I\\'ve loved - even if they are no longer close to me -because they fundamentally shaped and changed me. And because they\\'ve become part of my everyday fabric and I like having them there. \\n\\nAnyhow, I\\'m not sure what to do with all this. I don\\'t really care about having children (I can\\'t and don\\'t want to anyhow) so that\\'s not a concern. It\\'s just that when I think of how long it has been since I felt loved romantically by someone (my last boyfriend abused me for three relentless years) I get really, really sad.  I\\'m this person\\'s height (4\\'11\") and I do this all the time. Without shoes on. And then I sterilize the counter. A chair isn\\'t tall enough for shorties to reach the top shelf!\\n\\n(I am not 12 years old, and I suspect the girl in the photograph is not as well.) It\\'s ok to break up with someone for any reason or no reason at all. You can break up with someone even if you love them if the relationship doesn\\'t work for you. You have this Internet stranger\\'s permission to do what you want to do here. \\n\\nTry to be compassionate when you do it. The old \"it\\'s not you it\\'s me\" but much softer: \"Clara, I know we have had good times together. But right now I have a lot of work to do on myself. I need to figure myself out and I need to do it alone while single. You\\'re a wonderful woman and I love you but I can\\'t be in a relationship with you.\"\\n\\nThen move, if you live together, and take some time to yourself to recover from the relationship. Even if you aren\\'t attracted to her anymore you will probably miss her. Take some time to learn who you are again \\n\\nGood luck. You can do this.  That \"someone\" was wrong. Being able to spend time alone and loving someone are not mutually exclusive. I would go crazy if I didn\\'t have time apart from my boyfriend. We recently spent three days together and I was so ready to spend some time alone after that! He is also really into spending time alone, and when we met and he told me that I was thrilled.\\n\\nThere are people out there who value their alone time just as much as you do. Instead of lying, try to be honest with your next girlfriend. Tell her upfront that you need your alone time. That will weed out the people who don\\'t understand and help you build a workable relationship with someone that understands you and respects this need.  You look great! So much more confident and happy. I love your hair, too - it\\'s so shiny. :) Oh, I had a boyfriend like this. He wasn\\'t even satisfied when I weighed 88 pounds and was starving myself.\\n\\nYour husband is being extraordinarily selfish. Like, seriously privileged and selfish. Tell him to grow the fuck up or to get out of your house. This list of [questions couples should ask before marriage](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/17/fashion/weddings/17FIELDBOX.html) published in the New York Times is pretty great. Lots of things to consider.  The \"sweetest guy in the world\" would keep this thought to himself.  There\\'s a difference between honesty and cruelty.  I wax for myself. My boyfriend could not care less what i do with my pubic hair.\\n\\nWaxing hurts less the more you do it. If you go regularly, you really will get used to it. The first time I went I was in a lot of pain, but now I can\\'t miss an appointment because I love it so much and the pain is minimal and worth it. You know the answer. It\\'s because he\\'s a jerk who doesn\\'t care about your feelings. No, really. That\\'s really what this is about. Trust your gut and dump this guy. You\\'re going to find a man who does not pull this kind of ridiculous shit, and you\\'ll look back on this wanker and laugh someday. Why are you guys talking about this? You shouldn\\'t know what \"number\" your boyfriend thinks you are. Your boyfriend shouldn\\'t be rating you on a scale, even if you ask.\\n\\nI\\'m not a 10/10. I know it. I know that I\\'m not the hottest woman in the world; heck, I\\'m reasonably sure that I\\'m not the most attractive woman that my current boyfriend has ever dated. But we don\\'t talk about that. Why would we? He chooses to be with me and that\\'s enough. \\n\\nDating is not about looks. It\\'s not about the way you look. Sure, you want to be sexually attracted to your partner. But that\\'s not the only thing that matters, and frankly, your appearance? It\\'s really pretty low on the scale of things that matter in a partner - especially as you age.\\n\\nDon\\'t stand for guys that tell you your number. Don\\'t ask them your number. Just stay away from the topic. The boyfriend that I did have that let me know that he thought I was a 4 hurt me so much - there\\'s no reason to talk about that stuff. No reason for him to bring that up to me. Now, he was abusive and mean and he wanted to tell me I was a 4 to hurt my feelings and to make me feel bad - and because he was a relentless jerk and he really saw me as a \"4\". Now, my nice, kind, caring boyfriend? He treats me like the hottest woman in the world. And I know I\\'m not, and he knows I\\'m not, but he sees me as a beautiful woman because he cares for all of me. Not just my face and my body. He likes my brain; he likes the way I cook; he likes that I have hobbies I care about. He likes how I relate to other people. He likes ME. Not my body, not my face. Me.\\n You are in a relationship with him as he is right now, not with him as he might be later if he happens to change.\\n\\nThis is the hardest lesson I\\'ve ever had to learn, but if you don\\'t want to be in the relationship you are in, right now, for the rest of your life, with the man you are with as he is right now - assume he will never change, most people don\\'t - it\\'s time to walk away.  Truth. * obsessed with fetch\\n* begs for food like she\\'s deprived of proper meals (she\\'s not, trust me)\\n* sleeps on back of the couch\\n* very well-behaved (won\\'t eat the cat\\'s food, which is always out, even when left home alone - after being yelled at for trying it once!)\\n* knows words (my name, her name, food, puggle, hungry, ball, outside, bed)\\n* barks at the mail man and delivery men\\n* chews her bone for about an hour after I or my boyfriend walk in the door after work - after an enthusiastic greeting, of course\\n* sleeps under the covers\\n* always underfoot \\n* always needs to be touching everyone\\n* will lick anything in her path\\n* did I mention she\\'s obsessed with fetch? I love the cocoon half of the [BFF cowl](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/bff-cowl) - it\\'s really scrumptious in worsted yarn and takes 1 skein. \\n\\n(Psst LinkRav - do your thing!) Actually, I think you\\'re in the wrong here. Your girlfriend wasn\\'t outright rude, and it is your job to be honest with your mom about stuff. You lied to your mom and now your girlfriend is rightly upset.\\n\\n\"The only thing my mom wanted was a legitimate thank you.\"\\n\\nWell, she couldn\\'t possibly get this. Your girlfriend couldn\\'t give a legitimate thank you - she didn\\'t want this thing and you didn\\'t express that at all to your family. This one is on you.\\n\\nWith your next girlfriend, work on better communication.\\n\\nAlso I would not be down with my boyfriend\\'s mom showing up at my place while I was still asleep. It sounds like you\\'re really involved with your parents still. It\\'s going to be difficult for you to find a woman who is OK with how involved your mom is in your (and by extension, her) life.'"
